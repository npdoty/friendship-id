              Protocol for Omnidirectional Open Friendship
                        draft-doty-friendship-00

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism for discovering endpoints for
   making friends (friendpoints); an HTTP-based, application-layer
   method for creating friendships; and requirements for friends.  These
   elements constitute the Protocol for Omnidirectional Open Friendship
   (POOF).

1.  Introduction

   Friendship has gotten pretty complicated in this day and age.  Making
   new friends is lamentably difficult.  We, the authors, are sad and
   lonely people.  What with Facebook and all, and are we networking or
   flirting or what?

   To address this problem, we document the following open protocol for
   making new friends.  Users of the Web can discover friendpoints while
   browsing the Web and direct their user agents to create a new
   friendship through the method described in the "Making a Friend"
   section below.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Friendpoint Discovery

   A server MAY indicate a new friends endpoint (hereafter
   "friendpoint") with text of a web page describing the results of the
   action.  The following text is RECOMMENDED for English-language
   servers:

      + Add me as a friend

   Italics are OPTIONAL.  An exclamation point MAY be added, to indicate
   an imploring, desperate tone through feigned excitement.  The text
   SHOULD use the imperative mode for the human-readable description.

   No machine-readable means for friendpoint discovery is provided,
   because machines cannot have friends, cannot experience love and
   cannot pick you up from the airport.  We MUST NOT be friends with
   robots.

3.  Making a Friend

   To create a friendship with the operator of the server, a user MUST
   submit an HTTP POST request to the friendpoint.  The body of the
   request SHOULD be empty and servers SHOULD ignore the body of the
   request, except for any tokens for preventing cross-site request
   forgery.  (See Security Considerations, below.)

   A server should respond to the HTTP request with a status code to
   indicate the success or failure of creating a new friendship between
   the user and the operator of the server.  For success, the server
   MUST respond with a status code in the 200 series.  The following
   text is RECOMMENDED for the body of the response:

      We are now friends!

3.1.  Example

   Nick browses to andrewbadr.com with his user agent and sees a link to
   "+ Add me as a friend".  He clicks on the link to submit an HTML form
   and his user agent sends an HTTP POST request to the friendpoint:

      POST /friend/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: andrewbadr.com

   And a successful response from the server indicates that Andrew and
   Nick are now friends:

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Date: Wed, 20 August 2008 04:42:29 GMT

      We are now friends!

4.  Friendship

   In all future interactions after the POST request is completed
   successfully, the operator of the client MUST treat the operator of
   the server as a friend and the operator of the server MUST treat the
   operator of the client as a friend.  A friend MUST say hello and
   smile when passing you on the street and MUST tell you when there's
   something stuck to your shirt.  A friend SHOULD invite you to social
   events, stick up for you in arguments with strangers and visit you if
   you're in the hospital in the same town.

   A friend also MAY pick you up from the airport, listen to you
   complain about your significant other and help you move apartments
   when you were too cheap to hire someone.  A friend MAY drive you out
   to the edge of town, just anywhere, just to get away, when you feel
   like you've had enough.  A friend MAY commit perjury on the witness
   stand to protect you.  A true friend MAY remember your birthday
   without Facebook or the use of other friendship protocols.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.  Friendships do not need
   to be memorialized in any registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   Friendship necessarily involves vulnerability.
